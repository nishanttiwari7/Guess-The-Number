# Guess-The-Number


This repository contains two interactive web components: a Number Guessing Game and an Accordion. Both are built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## Number Guessing Game

### Description
The Number Guessing Game allows users to guess a randomly generated number between 1 and 100. Users have 6 attempts to guess the correct number. The game provides feedback on whether the guess is too high or too low and shows the total number of attempts. Once the user runs out of attempts or guesses correctly, they can restart the game.
